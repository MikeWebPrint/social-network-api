  ## Description
  
  AS A social media startup, I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data. GIVEN a social network API, WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database. WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database. WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.
